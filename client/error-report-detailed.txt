File Analysis:
- CacheManagementDashboard.tsx:
  * JSX structure issue at line 121 (missing parent element)
  * Invalid character at line 140
  * Multiple unclosed tags

- marketingAI.ts:
  * Invalid characters at lines 130, 215, 223
  * Missing commas at line 176
  
Suggested Manual Fixes:
1. Open CacheManagementDashboard.tsx and check the return statement structure
2. Ensure all JSX elements have proper closing tags
3. Check marketingAI.ts for any remaining template literal issues
